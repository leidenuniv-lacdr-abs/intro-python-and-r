# Introduction into Python and R

This collection of [Jupyter notebooks](https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/) should help you get started with Python and R. It starts with the basics and will soon have some more advanced notebooks. All notebooks are available online and can be used on your local machine, or using [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/leidenuniv-lacdr-abs/intro-python-and-r.git/master). For the Python notebooks we are experimenting with the Google [Colab environment](https://colab.research.google.com/github/leidenuniv-lacdr-abs/intro-python-and-r/blob/master/Python/Basics.ipynb).

You should be able to follow the tutorials on your own time and at your own pace, but if you have questions please use the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/leidenuniv-lacdr-abs/intro-python-and-r/issues) option to ask for help or for providing feedback.
